The game is layed with **_WASD_** keys the W key goes up, D key go right, S key will go down and the A key goes left. When the blue ball met with the green square goal YOU WILL WIN!!!

Do not hold on keys too long because the ball go across the wall and arena and it disappear. This issue is caused by the Matter.js library.
